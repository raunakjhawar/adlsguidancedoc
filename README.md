# Hitchhiker's Guide to the Datalake

As part of helping our customers build their analytics solutions on ADLS Gen2, we have a collection of considerations and key learnings that have been effective in building highly scalable and performant data lakes on Azure. We have distilled these learnings in our guidance document - [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Data Lake](Hitchhikers_Guide_to_the_Datalake.md).

We hope you enjoyed reading the doc and found the guidance helpful. Please share your questions/comments/feedback as GitHub issues. If you are interested in contributing, please submit a pull request with your proposed changes. We will incorporate that post review.
